# Introduction

## What is GOMAP?

Gene Ontology - Meta Annotator for Plants (**GOMAP**) is a pipeline that annotates GO terms to plant protein sequences. The pipeline uses three different approaches to annotate GO terms to plant proteins and uses a mix of custom code and existing software tools to assign GO terms. The pipeline was designed to create a high confidence GO annotation dataset for reference proteomes, and it is recommended that
the pipeline in its current form used for that.

### This version of GOMAP is only intended for development purposes. Please use [GOMAP-singularity](https://github.com/Dill-PICL/GOMAP-singularity) for annotating plant protein sequences

Please see **TODO** for detailed documentation
